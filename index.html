            <h3>1. Family Background</h3>
            <p>I was born in an ordinary three-person family. My father was a taxi driver and had to go to work every morning. My mother was a worker in a construction company and often needed to go out to work. They worked so hard for me to study and hope that I could achieve something. They love me very much, but they will still discipline me in a strict way, hoping that I can also learn independently and actively. After I learned a lesson, they would give me timely encouragement and advice so that I could learn from my failures.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Interests and expertise</h3>
            <p>Curious, I am often interested in new things, such as foreign languages, fancy sports, scientific and technological research, photography, etc. Among my many interests, I especially love learning about technology, because I already enjoyed playing with robots when I was a kid. Usually, I am used to listening to music, mainly English songs, and sometimes I sing along. After school, I will go to the library to read computer books and newspapers and magazines to enrich myself.
                I have always believed that being a real student should not only be studying, but should be exposed to a wide range of things, and cultivate one's own expertise and develop a healthy body and mind, so I participated in the school's fancy rope skipping school team and got good grades 's results. In addition, I feel that I have the ability to organize and lead, so I have taken up a disciplined position and participated in volunteer work, and my serious and responsible attitude has been affirmed by the teachers.</p>
